To use the library create a main.cc file in the gmml root directory
Use the following command to compile your program
(This makes all the linkings to the library files and corresponding object files)

g++ -Iincludes/* -Lbin/ main.cc -lgmml -o bin/gmml

This creates an executable file named gmml under the bin directory,
which you can run using the following command:

./gmml [optional arguments]
